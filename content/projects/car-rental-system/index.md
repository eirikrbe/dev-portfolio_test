A command-line car rental management system built solo for MSE800 (object-oriented programming) at Yoobee College. Customers register, book and cancel; admins manage the fleet and the full booking lifecycle.

## The interesting part

Two mechanisms make this more than a CRUD exercise:

- **VIN-locking** — while a booking is pending, the vehicle's VIN is locked so no conflicting reservation can be created against the same car.
- **Vehicle confidence score** — a weighted rating (booking reliability 40%, mileage 25%, age 20%, conflict history 15%) that helps users judge how dependable a vehicle is before they book it.

## How it's built

- **Python 3.10+** with a layered structure: CLI, services, models, and database queries kept separate
- **SQLite** for storage
- **bcrypt** for password hashing
- A factory for user creation, plus seeded demo data for easy exploration
