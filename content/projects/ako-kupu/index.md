*Kupu* means words; *ako* is the reciprocal learning between teacher and student. Ako-Kupu is a Te Reo Māori flashcard and learner-progress web application built as a two-person team project for MSE800 at Yoobee College.

## What it does

Learners work through Te Reo Māori vocabulary as flashcards and track their progress over time. An AI learning layer built on the Google Gemini API enriches the experience — and the app is deliberately designed to boot and run without the API key, with only the AI features degrading.

## How it's built

- **Flask** with the app-factory pattern and blueprints
- **Neon PostgreSQL** accessed through raw **psycopg 3** — no ORM, so the SQL is explicit and reviewable
- **Docker** for containerisation, deployed on **Render**
- **pytest** for tests, with **Pylint** (minimum score 8.0) enforced before commits

## Process

The project ran on a full Jira and Confluence workflow with three sprint epics, using the GitHub for Jira integration so branches, commits and pull requests were linked to issues via issue keys.
